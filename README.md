Using this prompt:
```help me write a car-racing game in JS that can run in browser. The car speed is control by speed of clicking keyboard left & right key frequently. The car start from left and go to right horizontally, and please have a start button each round and a timer to show the duration i have use in each round. in the result page, show the time i have used. ```

And later request to add responsive:
```pls support responsive in mobile, add two arrow button on top of screen that can click too```


Manual fixed code:
1. The left & right arrow button in keyboard is not working as i expected, iterate a lot of time but still not working, found it difficult to instruct the LLM.
2. Some responsive UI.
